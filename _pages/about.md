I'm currently a third-year Ph.D. candidate (2020 Fall - Now) in Computer Science and Engineering at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/), advised by [Prof. Fanny Ye](http://yes-lab.org). Besides, I'm extremely fortunate to cooperate closely with [Prof. Chuxu Zhang](https://chuxuzhang.github.io) from Brandeis University. Before that, I received my B.S. degree from Xidian University and M.S. degree from The Ohio State University.

My research field lies in graph machine learning and its application. Specifically, I enjoy doing resarch on semi-supervised and self-supervised representation learning via graph neural networks.
